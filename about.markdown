About Me
=================

Hello! My name is Taiki Aiba, a first year master's student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am double majoring in Computer Science, with a specialization in Machine Learning, and Mathematics. I also graduated with a triple bachelor's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology in August 2025 in Computer Science, with concentrations in Intelligence and Systems/Architecture, Mathematics, with concentrations in Discrete Mathematics and Business, and Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies, with a concentration in Japanese. I also finished a minor in Economics.

Below is a list of organizations and communities I am currently/was formerly involved with:

Computer Science:

* ??? - As a Software Engineer Intern in Summer 2026, I will do stuff.
* Amazon - As a Software Development Engineer Intern in Summer 2024, I developed a discrete event simulation model in SimPy to predict and visualize the latencies of incoming packets in one of Alexa's nodes. I wrote a script in C++ to feed packets of Gaussian-distributed sizes/arrival times. Then, I parsed CSV strings/JSON arrays with Python to extract mean and individual packet latency/size data. Finally, I compared latency to size graphs with Matplotlib to form a quadratic of fit with small sizes for training.
* Undergraduate Research for GT Vertically Integrated Projects - Under Prof. Aaron Lanterman in Fall 2023, I worked in the [Retrofuturistic Hardware](https://www.vip-consortium.org/teams/retrofuturistic-hardware) team. Our project was about the PC-FX video game console, where we explored the documentation of the machine and translated it from Japanese to English. We researched the C Compiler of the GMAKER Starter Kit (processing flow/registers), allowing user-made software to run. Finally, we wrote graphical software in C with the kit to run on the PC-FX to showcase its usability.
* Teaching Assistant for CS 3510: Algorithms - Under Prof. Abrahim Ladha in Fall 2024, Fall 2025, and Spring 2026 and Prof. Zongchen Chen in Spring 2025, I grade homework and exams, host weekly office hours, and teach exam review sessions averaging 30-40 students.
* Teaching Assistant for CS 2050: Discrete Mathematics - Under Prof. Ronnie Howard in Summer 2023 and Fall 2023 and Prof. Gerandy Brito in Spring 2024, I graded homework and exams, wrote the homework assignments, hosted weekly office hours, and taught weekly recitation sections with 5-10 students.
* Course Assistant for CS 124: Intro to CS I - Under Prof. Geoffrey Challen in Spring 2022, I hosted virtual office hours and assisted students on the course help forum.
* Competitive Programming @ Tech - I have participated in weekly practices and attended competitions like ICPC and MAPS since Fall 2022. I also competed in the 2022 and 2024 ICPC Southeast Regional competitions. Finally, I am currently a Specialist on the platform [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), but I am hoping to improve my skills and eventually become a Candidate Master (or better!).
* Big O Theory Club - This is a club where members can volunteer to present topics on theoretical computer science and mathematics. I have occasionally attended meetings since Fall 2023.

Mathematics:

* Quads Research Group - In Summer 2024, I attended the Polymath Jr REU and joined the Quad Packing subteam within the Games and Finite Geometry team, whose goal is to find the maximum number of quads in a deck of a given size. In January 2025, I presented at the 2025 Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM), where I met other researchers and formed the Quads Research Group. It was also here where I was declared the King of Set in the first annual JMM National Set Championships. In Summer 2025, I was a Graduate Research Mentor for the Polymath Jr REU for the Quad Packing subteam, introducing more undergraduates to Quads and our research problem. In January 2026, we presented new results at the 2026 Joint Mathematics Meetings.
* Undergraduate/Graduate Research in Mathematics - Under Dr. Ernie Croot, in 2023-2024, we explored bijections of counting problems to spanning trees and explored ways to use the Matrix-Tree Theorem to strengthen known bounds on the counting of configurations. In 2024-2025, we worked on finding asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the size of a maximal induced forest in grid graphs over a result by Noga Alon from 2001. In 2025-2026, we are working on a simpler but related problem involving 4-cycle avoidance in induced subgraphs of 2D grid graphs.
* Learning Assistant for MATH 2551: Multivariable Calculus - Under Prof. Gregory Mayer in Spring 2023, I assisted high school students in the Distance Math program, hosting weekly office hours and grading homework and exams.
* Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) Academy - As a Math Teaching Assistant at the Lexington campus since July 2022, I have assisted instructors in the 2022 (prealgebra and geometry) and 2025 (high school math contests and algebra 1) summer camps and assisted in Zoom office hours throughout the school year.
* [Undergraduate Mathematics Advisory Committee (UMAC)](https://umac.math.gatech.edu/) - This is a new organization that plans events and activities for undergraduate math majors. In Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, I was one of the website editors as well as one of the members in the Design/Marketing branch. From Fall 2023 to Spring 2025, I served as a co-president of UMAC, where I lead and handled the logistics of all events and updated the website after each one with photos and the flyer.
* [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.gatech.edu/directed-reading-program) - I read about generating functions in combinatorics and algebra in Fall 2022, combinatorial problem solving techniques in Spring 2023, the Union-Closed Sets Conjecture in Fall 2023, the game of Sudoku in relation with graph theory in Spring 2024, quantitative finance in Fall 2024, and data structures and algorithms, focusing on the Gomory-Hu Tree, in Spring 2025.
* GT Competitive Math - This is a new organization formed in May 2023 that discusses math contests in a club Discord server. I am the founder and a current co-president of the club.
* Club Math - This is a social club that comes up with problems to solve every week. I have occasionally attended meetings since Fall 2022.
