About Me
=================

Hello! My name is Taiki Aiba, a first year master's student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am double majoring in Computer Science, with a specialization in Machine Learning, and Mathematics. I also graduated with a triple bachelor's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology in August 2025 in Computer Science, with concentrations in Intelligence and Systems/Architecture, Mathematics, with concentrations in Discrete Mathematics and Business, and Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies, with a concentration in Japanese. I also finished a minor in Economics.

I used to participate in math competitions a lot. Here are some of my achievements:

* University of Illinois Freshman Math Contest Honorable Mention (2021) (rank 3)
* Princeton University Mathematics Competition (PUMaC) Division B Individual Finalist (2021) (rank 39)
* American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) Qualifier (2019, 2020, 2021) (top score 10)
* USA Mathematical Talent Search (USAMTS) Bronze Medalist (2019, 2021)

I was also an active member on the Art of Problem Solving forums as [DeToasty3](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/324129).

Below is a list of organizations and communities I am currently/was formerly involved with:

* Formed an 85%-accurate quadratic of fit, training with small sizes and comparing latency to size graphs with Matplotlib.

<!-- I developed a discrete event simulation model in SimPy to predict and visualize the latencies of incoming packets in one of Alexa's nodes. I wrote a script in C++ to feed packets of Gaussian-distributed sizes/arrival times. Then, I parsed CSV strings/JSON arrays with Python to extract mean and individual packet latency/size data. Finally, I compared latency to size graphs with Matplotlib to form a quadratic of fit with small sizes for training. -->
