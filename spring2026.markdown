# Spring 2026

So on this page, I'll just talk about stuff related to Spring 2026.

#### CS 6515: Introduction to Graduate Algorithms
TR 2:00-3:15

No finals, 3 midterms (25% each), 7-8 HWs (25%)

Homework 1 (due 1/29) - **Score TBA**. Pretty doable; problem 2 was dropped and the rest were fairly quick, too.


#### CS 7634: AI Storytelling in Virtual Worlds
MW 9:30-10:45

No finals, no midterms, 2 group projects (35% each), 1 HW (10%), summaries (20%)

Story Generation Exercise (due 1/25) - **Score TBA**. Really easy. Ask ChatGPT to write a 1500+ word crime mystery and write your review on how it did!


#### CS 7637: Knowledge-Based AI
TR 3:30-4:45

No finals, 2 take-home midterms (10%, 15%), 1 individual final project (with 4 milestones) (35%), 5 HWs (25%), participation (15%)

RPM Milestone 1 (due 1/30) - **Score TBA**.


#### ISYE 6416: Computational Statistics
TR 12:30-1:45

Final exam (25%), 2 midterms (25% each), 11? HWs (25%)

Final exam period: R 5/7 11:20-2:10

Homework 1 (due 1/27) - **9.5/10**. Got a few points taken off on random problems. Part 1 was easy, just copy from the slides. Part 2 required a mini report, which I bluffed but somehow got 4.9/5 on it.


#### MATH 6321: Functions of a Complex Variable I
MW 12:30-1:45

Final exam (30%), 2 midterms (20% each), 5-6 HWs? (30%)

Final exam period: W 5/6 11:20-2:10

Homework 1 (due 1/28) - This took around 5-6 hours and had 6 problems. I thought it would be hard but didn't turn out as bad as expected. Hardest problems were the first and third ones.


#### MATH 6455: Differential Geometry I
MW 11:00-12:15

I have no idea what this class has.


#### MATH 7018: Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics
MW 3:30-4:45

Final exam (30%), 2 midterms (15% each), 5 HWs (40%)

Final exam period: F 5/1 2:40-5:30

Homework 1 (due 1/23) - **20/20**. The first three problems were standard, the last one was also normal but required some more work (with lin alg knowledge), and the fourth one was the hardest and it took a few hours.
