<!-- I am a very sad subpar specimen of a college student whose only interests lie in watching anime and playing video games. I have approximately as many friends as I have brain cells, and would love nothing more than just spending all my days not doing excessively difficult math competitions and instead playing Kirby Super Star. -->

Hello! I'm Taiki, a Computer Science and Mathematics double master's at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This website contains a few pages:

* About Me - background about me
* College Courses - a list of courses I've taken in college
* Toasty's Problem Stash - where I will occasionally post a math problem that I wrote
* DMC - the home page for the De Mathematics Competitions
* KMMC - the home page for the Karate Masters Mathematics Competitions
* DMC Archives - the AoPS collection for all past DMC competitions

If you would like to contact me, feel free to reach out to me via email at <taikiaiba@gmail.com>. Additionally, here is my [resume](/Resume.pdf).
