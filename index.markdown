About Me
=================

I am a very sad subpar specimen of a college student whose only interests lie in watching anime and playing video games. I have approximately as many friends as I have brain cells, and would love nothing more than just spending all my days not doing excessively difficult math competitions and instead playing Kirby Super Star.

The DMC (De Mathematics Competitions) is a nonprofit organization led by me that writes math contests. For more information, visit the DMC page.
