Toasty's Problem Stash
=================

I like writing math problems! Whenever I feel like it, I'm going to add a new problem I've written here.

**(10/1/2022)** Let quadrilateral ABCD be inscribed in a circle. Let the line through B perpendicular to AC intersect on side AD at a point E. If AE=BE=DE=5 and AB=6, what is CD?
